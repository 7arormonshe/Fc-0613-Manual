If your Presto appliance uses a Control Master heat control, the model number is generally found stamped on the left side of the plug guard on the bottom of the appliance. Please note: If you have a cool-touch griddle, it is located on the black frame by the plug guard.

If you have a Presto pressure cooker or canner, the model number is found in one of three places: a tag on the cover, stamped on the bottom of the body, or stamped on the side of the body just below the body handle.
 
If you are unable to locate the model number of your appliance or the instruction book, please contact our Consumer Service Department at 1-800-877-0441. Representatives are available Monday-Friday 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Central Time.
 
The VSI OpenVMS System Analysis Tools Manual is intended primarily for the system programmer or analyst who must investigate the causes of system failures and debug kernel-mode code, such as a device driver.
 
This manual also includes system management information for maintaining the system resources necessary to capture and store system crash dumps, including the use of dump-off-system-disk (DOSD). To help determine the cause of a hung process or improve system performance, consult this manual for instructions on using the appropriate system analysis tool to analyze your system.
 
You may send comments or suggestions regarding this manual or any VSI document by sending electronic mail to the following Internet address: . Users who have VSI OpenVMS support contracts through VSI can contact for help with this product.
 
In command format descriptions, brackets indicate optional choices. You can choose one or more items or no items. Do not type the brackets on the command line. However, you must include the brackets in the syntax for OpenVMS directory specifications and for a substring specification in an assignment statement.
 
In command format descriptions, vertical bars separate choices within brackets or braces. Within brackets, the choices are options; within braces, at least one choice is required. Do not type the vertical bars on the command line.
 
Italic text indicates important information, complete titles of manuals, or variables. Variables include information that varies in system output (Internal error number), in command lines (/PRODUCER= name), and in command parameters in text (where dd represents the predefined code for the device type).
 
In the C programming language, monospace type in text identifies the following elements: keywords, the names of independently compiled external functions and files, syntax summaries, and references to variables or identifiers introduced in an example.
 
The OpenVMS system dump analyzer (SDA) utility enables you to analyze a running system or a system dump after a system failure occurs. With a system failure, the operating system copies the contents of memory to a system dump file or the primary page file. Additionally, it records the hardware context of each processor. With SDA, you can interpret the contents of the dump file, examine the status of each processor at the time of the system failure, and investigate possible causes of failure.
 
The OpenVMS System Code Debugger (SCD) allows you to debug nonpageable system code and device drivers running at any interrupt priority level (IPL). You can use the SCD to perform the following tasks:
 
SCD recognizes the syntax, data typing, operators, expressions, scoping rules, and other constructs of a given language. If your code or driver is written in more than one language, you can change the debugging context from one language to another during a debugging session.
 
SDD recognizes the syntax, data typing, operators, expressions, scoping rules, and other constructs of a given language. If your code or driver is written in more than one language, you can change the debugging context from one language to another during a debugging session.
 
The OpenVMS Watchpoint utility allows you to maintain a history of modifications that are made to a particular location in shared system space. It sets watchpoints on 32-bit and 64-bit addresses, and watches any system addresses whether in S0, S1, or S2 space.
 
The OpenVMS Delta/XDelta debugger allows you to monitor the execution of user programs and the OpenVMS operating system. The Delta/XDelta debuggers both use the same commands and expressions, but they are different in how they operate. Delta operates as an exception handler in a process context; whereas XDelta is invoked directly from the hardware system control block (SCB) vector in a system context.
 
You use OpenVMS Delta instead of the OpenVMS symbolic debugger to debug programs that run in privileged processor mode at interrupt priority level (IPL) 0. Because Delta operates in a process context, you can use it to debug user-mode programs or programs that execute at interrupt priority level (IPL) 0 in any processor mode---user, supervisor, executive, and kernel. To run Delta in a processor mode other than user mode, your process must have the privilege that allows Delta to change to that mode: change-mode-to-executive (CMEXEC), or change-mode-to-kernel (CMKRNL) privilege. You cannot use Delta to debug code that executes at an elevated IPL. To debug with Delta, you invoke it from within your process by specifying it as the debugger instead of the symbolic debugger.
 
You use OpenVMS XDelta instead of the System Code Debugger when debugging system code that runs early in booting or when there is no Ethernet adapter that can be dedicated to SCD. Because XDelta is invoked directly from the hardware system control block (SCB), it can be used to debug programs executing in any processor mode or at any IPL level. To use XDelta, you must have system privileges, and you must include XDelta when you boot the system. Since XDelta is not process specific, it is not invoked from a process. To debug with XDelta, you must boot the system with a command to include XDelta in memory. XDelta's existence terminates when you reboot the system without XDelta.
 
On OpenVMS systems, XDelta supports 64-bit addressing. Quadword display mode displays full quadwords of information. The 64-bit address display mode accepts and displays all addresses as 64-bit quantities. XDelta has predefined command strings for displaying the contents of the page frame number (PFN) database.
 
The OpenVMS system allows you to write the system dump file to a device other than the system disk. This is useful in large memory systems and in clusters with common system disks where sufficient disk space, on one disk, is not always available to support your dump file requirements. To perform this activity, you must correctly enable the DUMPSTYLE system parameter to allow the bugcheck code to write the system dump file to an alternative device.
 
The Alpha EV7 On-chip Logic Analyzer utility (OCLA) enables a user to determine which instructions have executed on an Alpha EV7 CPU. One-seventh of the Alpha EV7 cache is set aside as acquisition memory where the virtual addresses of instructions executed by the Alpha EV7 CPU are stored. The acquisition memory can later by analyzed with SDA. For more information on OCLA, see Chapter 7.
 
This chapter describes the functions and the system management of SDA. It describes initialization, operation, and procedures in analyzing a system dump and analyzing a running system. This chapter also describes the SDA context, the command format, and the way both to investigate system failures and induce system failures.
 
When a system failure occurs, the operating system copies the contents of memory to a system dump file or the primary page file, recording the hardware context of each processor in the system as well. The System Dump Analyzer (SDA) is a utility that allows you to interpret the contents of this file, examine the status of each processor at the time of the system failure, and investigate the probable causes of the failure.
 
Although SDA provides a great deal of information, it does not automatically analyze all the control blocks and data contained in memory. For this reason, in the event of system failure, it is extremely important that you save not only the output provided by SDA commands, but also a copy of the system dump file written at the time of the failure.
 
Although analyzing a running system may be instructive, you should undertake such an operation with caution. System context, process context, and a processor's hardware context can change during any given display.
 
In a multiprocessing environment, it is very possible that, during analysis, a process running SDA could be rescheduled to a different processor frequently. Therefore, avoid examining the hardware context of processors in a running system.
 
The system manager must ensure that the system writes a dump file whenever the system fails. The manager must also see that the dump file is large enough to contain all the information to be saved, and that the dump file is saved for analysis. The following sections describe these tasks.
 
The operating system attempts to write information into the system dump file only if the system parameter DUMPBUG is set. (The DUMPBUG parameter is set by default. To examine and change its value, consult the VSI OpenVMS System Manager's Manual, Volume 2: Tuning, Monitoring, and Complex Systems.) If DUMPBUG is set and the operating system fails, the system manager has the following choices for writing system dumps:
